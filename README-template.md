## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for Components
- CSS Grid for overall layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive units, images, layouts supplemented with media queries
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Context API - For state management
- React Portal - For rendering components to other parts of the DOM
- localStorage API - For data persistence across sessions
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For styles
- Framer Motion - For animation
- Vite - Build tool

### What I learned

Styling SVGs, especially, to change their fill on hover was a challenge. Luckily, importing them as React Components did the trick. I needed vite-plugin-svgr to do that.

Another challenge was having a different transition based on the screen width.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [vite-plugin-svgr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-svgr) - This plugin, installed as a dev dependency made it possible to import the svg images as React Components and style them with CSS.
- [Deployment to Github Pages](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy) - Vite docs on the deployment of static pages to Github Pages
