## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox for Components
- CSS Grid for overall layout
- CSS custom properties for colors and transition states
- Responsive units, images, layouts supplemented with media queries
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) - For state management
- [React Portal](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal) - For rendering components to other parts of the DOM
- [localStorage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - For data persistence across sessions
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For scoped styles
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

Styling SVGs, especially, to change their fill on hover was a challenge. Luckily, importing them as React Components did the trick, and made it possible to change their fill with CSS. I needed [vite-plugin-svgr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-svgr) to do that.

Another challenge was having a different transition based on the screen width. I solved this problem by using CSS custom properties for the initial and final states (transform and opacity), and changed these based on a media query.

### Continued development

I would love to replicate this small app in other frameworks, like Vue.js or Svelte. Also, I would like to expand the list of desserts, maybe add other categories of foods, and have some sort of filtering and/or pagination.

### Useful resources

- [vite-plugin-svgr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-svgr) - This plugin, installed as a dev dependency made it possible to import the svg images as React Components and style them with CSS.
- [Deployment to Github Pages](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy) - Vite docs on the deployment of static pages to Github Pages

You can find more information on the technologies and APIs used in the Built with section.
